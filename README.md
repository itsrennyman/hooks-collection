# Hooks Collection

Collection of React Hooks I made during my Journey.

I decided to do this repo in order to keep track of the hooks i frequently use during my react applications development. These hooks are simply pasted into organized files and not distributed as a package for a couple of reason:

- There is already another library called [react-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use) which is distributing all the hooks as a package.
- It is more like an agenda for me, and i like the simplicity to copy and page in other project the logic of these hooks without searching it all my other projects.

If you like the idea, and you wanna contribute with something useful, feel free to do so.
